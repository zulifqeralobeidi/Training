Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa.
 His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa.
  His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.
   He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). 
   His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.
    His paternal grandmother had British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.

 <p> After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.
      Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."
       He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.

    At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using the Commodore VIC-20.He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game 
     he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500. An awkward and introverted child,Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.
      He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.

    Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate his great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan.He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics.

    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who had hired Musk, noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out." In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Ph.D. program in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his job inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an internet startup.
